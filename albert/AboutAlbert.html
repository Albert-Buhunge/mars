                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p> I am a very soft spoken individual who has a liking for Code and sports. I am quite fascinated by technology and my 
                    passion is Cyber Security.    
                </p>
                <p> I like to play basketball and soccer and for the better part of my life these days I am reading or finding the next 
                    interesting thing I can land on via the internet. I am not really a fan of movies but I can watch any MCU movie over
                    and over again, I love Guy Ritchie movies and I'm a sucker for investigative series or movies. Again, did I mention
                    I'm not a fan of movies?
                </p>
                <p> Ps: DC movies should really stop being produced.</p>
